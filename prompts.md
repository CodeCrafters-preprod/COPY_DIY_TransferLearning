## **Transfer Learning **  

### **Application Scenarios**  

1. **Business Problem: Image Dataset of Mask Detection**  
   - **Context**: As the world continues to grapple with public health challenges, especially in the context of infectious diseases, organizations (e.g., airports, shopping malls, public transportation systems) need to enforce mask-wearing to ensure the safety of employees and customers.  
   - **Problem Statement**: How can we effectively implement an automated mask detection system using computer vision to ensure compliance with mask mandates in crowded public spaces?  

2. **Business Problem: Text Dataset of Tweet Sentiment Analysis**  
   - **Context**: In todayâ€™s digital age, social media platforms like Twitter serve as a significant source of public opinion and consumer sentiment. Companies seek to understand customer sentiments to refine their marketing strategies and product offerings.  
   - **Problem Statement**: How can we analyze tweets to determine public sentiment towards a new product launch and gain insights that can inform marketing strategies?
